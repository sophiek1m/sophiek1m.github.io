    <h3><b>History of Tennis</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tennis dates back to 12th century France when it was played in the form of a handball game called <i>‘paume’</i> or palm. The game involved hitting a ball back and forth by hand. In time, a black leather glove was used and then from there a handle was added to the glove, which formed the first racquet.</li>
      <li>The game was originally played by monks as a form of entertainment during ceremonial occasions. Monks all over Europe enjoyed playing the game of “jeu de Paume” during the 14th century. Over time, the game spread and evolved throughout Europe and beyond.</li>
      <li>It is believed that the word ‘tennis’ is derived from an earlier version of the game played by monks in the 12th century. Their version of the game involved throwing and catching a ball while shouting “tenez,” which means to take heed.</li>
      <li>Original tennis balls were crafted from wood, it wasn’t until later that a cellulose material was used to make the balls bouncier.</li>
      <li>It is believed that the scoring system comes from medieval France and that a clock face was used to indicate the scores. For every point scored, the hand was moved to the next quarter (15, 30, 45). The first player to reach 60 was the winner and the game ended.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The scoring system is now 15, 30 and 40. One explanation for the discrepancy is that players had to win by two points, therefore the hand was moved to 40 and then 50 with the win coming on the hour.</li>
		</ul>
      <li>In 1873, Major Walter Wingfield invented a version of tennis that could be played outdoors on a lawn. This is the first instance where tennis began to look like the game we know and love today.</li>
      <li>In 1881, the very first US Open was played after America founded The United States National Lawn Tennis Association.</li>
      <li>In 1896, tennis was first played in the Olympic games.</li>
      <li>In 1897, the French Championships were opened to women tennis players for the first time in French history.</li>
